# Multiplayers Rock Paper Scissors
I was messing around with `socket`'s and wanted to make something with it because it seemed cool and decided a multiplayer game was a good way of applying my skills. What better game then Rock Paper Scissors?  
**NOTE**: This is simply a small project and only a small example, so a lot of the code isn't made to reflect what an *actual* multiplayer game would be built like or created. It's simply optimized to work on a single computer, with multiple scripts (servers, clients) running.

## Features
* Multiplayer allows for you to play with other people
    * Well, in this case, only on the same computer since the server uses `localhost` (127.0.0.1.)
* For offline players, includes a bot over multiplayer play
* Allows private servers to be setup
    * Again, in this case only on your own computer, but still works as a "private" server anyways

## TODO
- [ ] Add "Best of" gamemode
- [ ] Add "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" gamemode
- [ ] Add "Time limits" rule
- [ ] Add Custom Items
